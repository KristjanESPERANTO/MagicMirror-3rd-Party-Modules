# How to use Biome for your MagicMirror² module

It's recommend using a linter to help you catch errors and enforce coding standards in your JavaScript code. Biome is a fast all-in-one tool that can handle both linting and formatting.

If you want to better understand how to set up Biome by yourself, check out the [Biome documentation](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/).

## Guide to using Biome for your MagicMirror² module

This guide will help you set up Biome for your MagicMirror² module. It will cover the installation, configuration, and how to run it.

### 0 - Prerequisites

- Make sure you have a `package.json` file in your module's root directory. If you don't have one, you can create it by running `npm init -y` in your terminal.
- Make sure you have a `.gitignore` file in your module's root directory. If you don't have one, you can create it by running `touch .gitignore` in your terminal.
- Add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing the `node_modules` directory to your repository.

### 1 - Install Biome

Install Biome as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @biomejs/biome
```

### 2 - Create Biome configuration file

Create a file named `biome.jsonc` in the root directory of your module:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/2.0.5/schema.json",
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "double"
    }
  }
},
```

### 3 - Add scripts to package.json

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "biome lint .",
    "lint:fix": "biome lint --write .",
    "format": "biome format --write .",
    "check": "biome check ."
  }
},
```

### 4 - Run Biome

Run linting:

```bash
node --run lint
```

Run linting with automatic fixes:

```bash
node --run lint:fix
```

Run formatting:

```bash
node --run format
```

Run all checks:

```bash
node --run check
```
