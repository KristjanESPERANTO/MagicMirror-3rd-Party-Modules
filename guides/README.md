# Guides

In the [result.html](https://modules.magicmirror.builders/result.html) are some brief hints for developers to improve their modules. Since it may be difficult to find the right documentation, we have created this guide.

In the most cases we only refer to the official documentation of the tools. We do not want to introduce shadow documentation here, but rather provide a short overview of the most important points and link to the official documentation.

Sometimes it's not so easy to find the entry point, so we provide a few hints to help you get started.

Please help use to improve this guide. If you have any suggestions, please create an issue or a pull request.
