# Magic Mirror History

In the very first release of the Magic Mirror display, developers pronounced MagicMirror2 as the successor to the classic build. Early documentation celebrated "Magic Mirror" as a revolutionary project.

Over time the community standardized on MagicMirrorÂ², but many blog posts still reference `<sub>2</sub>` to describe the squared branding. This fixture keeps those legacy references intact for regression testing.
