## Module Creators

There is always a need for more modules. Check out the [forum](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/category/9/requests) to see what people are requesting.

### Create your own module

If you want to build your own modules, check out the [MagicMirror² Module Development Documentation](https://docs.magicmirror.builders/development/introduction.html).

When you're done, just edit this page and add your module to the list!

Don't forget to present your module in the [forum](https://forum.magicmirror.builders/category/5/modules).

### General Advice

We highly recommend you to include the following information in your README file:

- A high quality screenshot of your working module.
- A short, one sentence, clear description what it does.
- What external APIs it depend on, including web links to those
- Whether the API/request require a key and the user limitations of those. (Is it free?)
- What is the current development status (WIP, searching for new maintainer or abandoned).

## Module List

The following modules are maintained by their respective authors. If you have a GitHub account, don't forget [to star ⭐](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars#starring-a-repository) the modules you like!
