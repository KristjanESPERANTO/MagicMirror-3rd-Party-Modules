1. There is no `package.json`. We need this file to gather information about the module for the module list page.
2. Deprecated: Found `fs.F_OK` in file `node_helper.js`: Replace it with `fs.constants.F_OK`.
3. Recommendation: Found `"node-fetch"` in file `node_helper.js`: Replace it with built-in fetch ([documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch); [example module with fetch implemented](https://github.com/KristjanESPERANTO/MMM-ApothekenNotdienst/blob/main/node_helper.js)).

12. Recommendation: The README's install section should include a copyable fenced command block (for example ```bash ...).

### [MMM-EventHorizon by Mykle1](https://github.com/mykle1/MMM-EventHorizon)

### [MMM-MD by AndreaGrandieri](https://github.com/AndreaGrandieri/MMM-MD)

1. There is no `package.json`. We need this file to gather information about the module for the module list page.
2. Recommendation: Found `XMLHttpRequest` in file `MMM-MD.js`: Replace it with built-in fetch ([documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch); [example module with fetch implemented](https://github.com/KristjanESPERANTO/MMM-ApothekenNotdienst/blob/main/node_helper.js)).
3. Recommendation: Found `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com` in file `MMM-MD.js`: Prefer bundling dependencies via npm instead of CDN references.
4. Recommendation: Found `jshint` in file `bower.json`: Suggest migrating from JSHint to ESLint.

### [mm-music-player by AlexDespain01](https://github.com/AlexDespain01/mm-music-player)
