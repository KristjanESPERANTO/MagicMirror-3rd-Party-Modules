# P2.3 Rollout Plan — Port `check_modules.py` to TypeScript

_Last updated: October 1, 2025_

## Status Snapshot

- [x] **Phase 0 – Foundations:** Rule inventory, registry schema, curated fixtures, and comparison harness (incl. CI workflow) ✅ Completed Oct 2025
- [ ] **Phase 1 – TypeScript scaffold:** Implement TS pipeline core, land `--checks=ts` stage wiring
- [ ] **Phase 2 – Extended checks:** Port ESLint/deprecation helpers, add metrics & thresholds
- [ ] **Phase 3 – Cutover:** Flip default to TS, retire Python fallback after monitoring window

## 1. Objectives & Success Criteria

- **Primary goal:** Replace the Python-based `check_modules.py` pipeline stage with a TypeScript implementation that integrates with the shared utility layer introduced in P2.1.
- **Parity:** Preserve the existing rule coverage and output contract (`modules.stage.5.json`, markdown summaries, stats) so downstream stages remain unchanged.
- **DX improvements:** Enable feature-flagged execution (`--checks=legacy|ts`) to roll out the new implementation gradually without breaking current automation.
- **Observability:** Capture structured logs and rule-level metrics to evaluate performance and correctness compared with the Python version.

## 2. Scope Overview

- Re-implement the fast checks currently coded in `scripts/check_modules.py` using the shared TypeScript utilities (`fs-utils`, `logger`, schema validation).
- Maintain compatibility with the JSON schema for stage 5 artifacts (`modules.stage.5.json`).
- Support both orchestrator-driven runs and ad-hoc CLI invocation.
- Introduce configuration that maps each rule to metadata (category, severity, autofixable) in preparation for P4.1.

## 3. Phased Approach

| Phase                            | Focus                                                                                                                                                                                       | Deliverables                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Feature Flags                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phase 0: Foundations**         | Audit existing rules and categorize them (fast text scans, regex scans, external checks). Build a rule registry schema.                                                                     | ✅ Completed (Oct 2025): [Rule inventory](p2.3-rule-inventory.md), JSON schema for rule registry, [fixture harness plan](p2.3-fixture-harness-plan.md), [fixture selection](p2.3-fixture-selection.md), comparison harness + CI wiring. | n/a                                                    |
| **Phase 1: TypeScript scaffold** | Create `scripts/check-modules.ts` mirroring the legacy pipeline I/O (read stage 4, write stage 5). Implement the text scanning rules using the shared FS utilities and concurrency helpers. | New TS stage with `--experimental-strip-types` support; orchestrator stage command behind `--checks=ts`.                                                                                                                                | `--checks=legacy` (default) / `--checks=ts`            |
| **Phase 2: Extended checks**     | Port the ESLint/deprecation sub-checks and integrate Ajv validation directly into the TS pipeline.                                                                                          | TS wrappers for ESLint & custom rule runners; metrics logging.                                                                                                                                                                          | Same flag gating                                       |
| **Phase 3: Cutover**             | Flip the orchestrator default to TypeScript after comparison runs pass and performance targets are met. Retire Python fallback after a release cycle.                                       | Stage graph update, documentation updates, Python script archival.                                                                                                                                                                      | `--checks=legacy` retained for one release as fallback |

## 4. Guardrails & Tooling Updates

- **Comparison harness:** The CLI now runs both implementations against curated fixtures, emits `diff.json`/`diff.md`, and is exercised in CI via the scheduled/manual `check-modules-compare` workflow.
- **Schema validation:** Continue calling `validateStageFile("modules.stage.5", ...)` within the TS stage to enforce contracts.
- **Rate limiting:** Reuse the shared rate limiter if external HTTP calls remain necessary; otherwise ensure future network calls are coordinated.
- **Logging:** Adopt structured JSON logs with rule identifiers to feed future dashboards.

## 5. Testing Strategy

- Unit-like tests for rule helpers (regex/text scanners) using Jest or a lightweight harness executed via Node.
- Fixture-based regression tests comparing legacy vs TS outputs on the existing curated module set.
- CI job matrix that exercises `--checks=legacy`, `--checks=ts`, and the comparison harness (via the dedicated workflow) before the cutover.

## 6. Documentation & Communication

- Update `docs/architecture.md` when the TypeScript stage lands and again when the Python fallback is removed.
- Publish rollout status in the roadmap (P2.3 row) and note major milestones in release notes.
- Communicate CLI changes (`--checks` options, new logs) in `docs/pipeline/orchestrator-cli-reference.md`.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                                                  | Mitigation                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Diverging rule behavior between Python and TypeScript implementations | Use fixture diffing + snapshot tests during Phase 2 before enabling TS by default.                                                          |
| Performance regressions due to synchronous file reads                 | Utilize concurrency helpers and chunked scanning to parallelize safe operations.                                                            |
| ESLint/deprecation helpers lacking feature parity                     | Wrap existing JS helpers (`eslint_checks.py`, `deprecation_check.py`) temporarily via subprocess while porting to TypeScript incrementally. |
| Contributor confusion during dual-runtime period                      | Document the feature flag and default behavior prominently in CLI docs and README.                                                          |

## 8. Timeline Targets (Tentative)

1. **Phase 0 (1 week):** Rule inventory, registry schema, fixture adjustments — ✅ completed Oct 2025.
2. **Phase 1 (2 weeks):** TypeScript stage scaffold, orchestrator wiring, initial flag rollout in CI.
3. **Phase 2 (2–3 weeks):** Port extended checks, implement comparison harness, gather metrics.
4. **Phase 3 (1 week monitoring + release):** Flip default to TS, archive Python fallback post-release.

_Assumptions:_ Dedicated time from the pipeline maintainers, ability to extend the fixtures repo within the same sprint, and access to sample modules for benchmarking.

---

This plan should be revisited after Phase 1 to incorporate findings from the comparison harness and adjust timelines accordingly.
